This is done by checking for predefined macros specific to each compiler.\\n\\n- Defines macros for the platform (PLATFORM_ID) and architecture (ARCHITECTURE_ID)\\n\\n- Constructs string literals containing the compiler, platform, architecture and version information \\n\\n- Checks the C++ language standard and default extensions\\n\\n- The main() function simply returns the number of string literals defined, this is used by CMake to detect the information\\n\\nKey functions/macros:\\n\\n- COMPILER_ID - Identifies the compiler \\n- COMPILER_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH - Extracts version numbers\\n- PLATFORM_ID - Identifies the platform\\n- ARCHITECTURE_ID - Identifies the CPU architecture  \\n- info_compiler, info_platform, etc - String literals for output\\n- CXX_STD - Determines the C++ language standard\\n\\nSo in summary, it is a tool used by CMake to programmatically detect details about the compiler and build environment. This information is then used by CMake for configuration purposes.\&quot;,\&quot;/cmake-build-debug/CMakeFiles/3.26.4/CompilerIdC/CMakeCCompilerId.c\&quot;:\&quot;This file is used to detect the compiler and platform being used to compile a C/C++ program.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines macros and strings to identify the compiler (COMPILER_ID, COMPILER_VERSION, etc.) based on predefined macros provided by each compiler. It supports detecting many common compilers like GCC, Clang, MSVC, Intel, etc.\\n\\n- Defines macros and strings to identify the platform/OS (PLATFORM_ID) based on common platform defines. It supports detecting Linux, Windows, macOS, etc. \\n\\n- Defines macros to extract the major/minor/patch version numbers from the compiler version macros.\\n\\n- Constructs string literals containing the compiler, platform, architecture and version information.\\n\\n- Contains a main() function that prints out all the detected information.\\n\\nKey functions/macros:\\n\\n- COMPILER_ID - Identifies the compiler \\n- COMPILER_VERSION - Full compiler version number\\n- COMPILER_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH - Extracts version components\\n- PLATFORM_ID - Identifies the platform\\n- ARCHITECTURE_ID - Identifies the CPU architecture  \\n- info_compiler, info_platform, etc. - String literals of info\\n- DEC, HEX - Macros to convert version numbers to strings\\n- main() - Prints out all detection information\\n\\nSo in summary, it is a compiler/platform detection header that allows programs to identify at compile-time what compiler/platform is being used.\&quot;,\&quot;/cmake-build-debug/CMakeFiles/CMakeConfigureLog.yaml\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains the log output from CMake\\u0027s compiler detection and configuration process. Some key things it is doing:\\n\\n- Detecting the system (Windows) and compiler (GCC)\\n- Testing the C and C++ compilers to determine compiler ID, version, etc. \\n- Parsing the compiler output to determine implicit include paths, libraries, and linker settings\\n- Setting CMake variables like CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID based on the results\\n\\nThe main functions/steps are:\\n\\n- try_compile - Runs test compiles and links to get compiler output\\n- message - Outputs status messages \\n- CMAKE_DETERMINE_COMPILER_ID - Tests compiler ID \\n- CMAKE_DETERMINE_COMPILER_ABI - Tests compiler ABI\\n- CMAKE_TEST_C_COMPILER/CMAKE_TEST_CXX_COMPILER - General compiler tests\\n- Parsing the compiler output\\n   - Finding include paths\\n   - Finding libraries and objects\\n   - Finding linker search paths\\n- Setting CMake variables like CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER based on results\\n\\nSo in summary, it is detecting and configuring the native build tools (compiler, linker) that will be used for the project, by running tests and parsing the compiler output. This allows CMake to configure the build properly for that toolchain.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
